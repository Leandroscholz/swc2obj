# swc2obj
This project is to provide support for the Brain Trek Virtual Reality program by WVU-SNRC.  
swc2obj.py converts .swc files to .obj files.  
configmaker.py creates an Unreal Engine 4 .config file. 
flatten.mlx and invert.mlx are meshlab scripts.  Meshlab needs to be installed for the scripts to run.
